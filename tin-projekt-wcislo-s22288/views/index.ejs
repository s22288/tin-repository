      A film, also called a movie or motion picture, is a series of still images on a strip of plastic which, when
      run through a projector and shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images. A film is created by
      photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models
      using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI (Computer-generated imagery) and computer animation;
      or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. The process of filmmaking
      is both an art and an industry.

      Films usually include an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and
      other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for
      it and is not projected.

      Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect
      them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful
      medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of
      communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to
      translate the dialog into the language of the viewer.

      The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection, a rotating shutter causes
      intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not
      notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a
      visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due
      to a psychological effect called beta movement.

      The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically
      been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual
      motion picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay and flick. The most common term
      in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Terms for the field in general include the
      big screen, the silver screen, the movies and cinema; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and
      critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead
      of screen.
